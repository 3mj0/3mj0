    <img src="ribs.jpeg" alt="Finished Product">


    <h2>Description</h2>
    <P>This is probably my favourite too! They both chose the beef stew so I made her repick</P>
    <p>This would be them fall-off-the-bone type ribs that remind you magic and love is real!</p>
    <p>That "you're not yourself when you're hungry" type *insert happy dance* dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rack of ribs</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Beef Stock</li>
        <li>Romaine Lettuce</li>
        <li>Ceasar Dressing</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Crispy Croutons</li>
        <li>Real Parmesan Cheese</li>   
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put beef stock, siracha sauce and ribs into a pot and leave on medium-high heat for a bit</li>
        <li>Put bacon on to crisp it</li>
        <li>Wash the romaine lettuce and start to cut up into a big bowl</li>
        <li>Add ceasar dressing and completely cover lettuce</li>
        <li>Add crispy croutons</li>
        <li>Shred some parmesan cheese on top</li>
        <li>Add some more spices/seasoning to the ribs and put them in the oven on high-broil for 5-10 mins to crisp edges</li>
        <li>Break the cripsy bacon over the salad and mix in a little bit more sauce</li>
        <li>Remove the ribs from the oven and put it on the plate next to the salad</li>
        <li>Pairs well with anything! Ribs are life. Buuut tastes like heaven mixed with a tart red wine</li>
    </ol>
