            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Maggi. I'm a lover of all things tech, but mostly Cyber Security! I'm currently studying Full-Stack Development at the local University.</p>
            <p>I'm the Mother to 3 amazing children who I'm constantly learning from, especially patience! Lol. I wouldn't be who I am today without them.</p>
            <p>As a child who grew up in the system, I never thought I'd have this chance at life. I'm grateful everyday! I decided to share all the love I have, </p>
            <p>because after graduation, my kids are going to start the adoption/fostering process and start saving kids that way. In the mean time, I do what I can.</p>
            
            <p>My kids and I have started a t-shirt line to fundraise for our cause and to remind people to release it, and remember to breathe. </p>
            <p>If you'd like to suuport us and purchase one, you can do so at: </p>
